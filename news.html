        Twitter Facebook Messenger Pinterest Email print Just seconds after
        badly missing a 3-pointer off the backboard, Russell Westbrook came up
        with a big steal before sinking a clutch 3 that forced overtime to help
        the Los Angeles Lakers snap an 11-game road losing streak in Toronto
        Friday night. Westbrook's 3, which he hit after looking down and moving
        his foot off the 3-point line to make sure he shot a triple, came with
        nine-tenths of a second left in regulation before the Lakers outlasted
        the Raptors, 128-123, in overtime. In what has been a frustrating first
        season in Los Angeles, one of Westbrook's biggest highlights as a Laker
        could not have come at a better time. The win snapped a three-game
        losing streak for the Lakers, who had dropped 12 of their previous 15
        games. EDITOR'S PICKS Russ: Wolves' trash talk not worth responding to
        2dOhm Youngmisuk "I was actually looking at his feet when he was getting
        close to the 3-point line," LeBron James said of Westbrook's big shot.
        "And saw him step on the 3-point line and then slide his foot back
        before he released it. "Big-time IQ there on his part and a big-time
        shot by a big-time player." James had a big game himself, finishing with
        36 points, nine rebounds, seven assists and two emphatic blocks. This
        was the first game the Lakers have won since the All-Star break in which
        James didn't score 50 or more. And Westbrook helped make that happen
        with his 10th triple-double of the season with 22 points, 10 rebounds
        and 10 assists. The performance came one game after a loss in Minnesota
        that saw Karl-Anthony Towns and Patrick Beverley talk trash and taunt
        Westbrook and the Lakers in a 124-104 Timberwolves win on Wednesday.
        Westbrook's steal and clutch shot at the end of regulation also redeemed
        himself seconds after James missed a 3-pointer and Westbrook's missed 3
        high off the backboard with 12.5 seconds left. When asked how he has
        been able to block out the attention and criticism that some of his
        missed shots have garnered this season to hit a big one like he did in
        Toronto, Westbrook pointed to his career scoring resume. "Um, I got
        23,000 points," Westbrook said. "How about that?" Meanwhile, James is
        closing in on passing Karl Malone for second all-time in scoring in the
        NBA. He is now 20 points away from passing "The Mailman." After James
        logged 45 minutes, Lakers coach Frank Vogel said the team will discuss
        whether James will play on Saturday in Washington on the second of a
        back-to-back. If James rests, he could pass Malone in his return to
        Cleveland on Monday. Westbrook will try to give the Lakers their first
        winning streak since they won their fourth straight on Jan. 7, when he
        returns to Washington D.C. for the first time since he was traded from
        the Wizards. Westbrook said a moment like the one in Toronto came after
        he kept the faith through what has been a trying season for the Lakers.
        "Throughout this whole process, throughout the year, ups and downs, the
        good and the bad, I lean so much on my faith," Westbrook said. "And it's
        very important that I stay faithful and truthful to that because
        eventually it will all workout and nights like tonight was the reason
        why I stay just true to my faith."
